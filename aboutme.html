            <h1>Hello there! My name is Fulya Cevik</h1> 
            <p>I’m currently a Graphic Designer/Owner at Aileen’s Designs LLC
                We are very busy family owned Print Shop who are entrepreneurial
                spirit and a true team attitude.</p>
                
                <p> I approach design with both a keeping the user in mind throughout the process human-centered solutions and compelling visuals. I was born and raised in Turkiye, so I bring a sunny mentality to everything I do. </p>
                
                <p> My previous experiences Graphic Designer with pre-press experience. These experiences help me understand what it takes to build a business, nurture relationships, and reach people. In all my past experiences, an interest in problem-solving through design has been the common thread. 
                
                I’m student GWU UX/UI Bootcamp. With UX Design, my skills and passions merged into one job. </p>
                
                <p> In my free time, I bring that creative thinking to my work as a UX Designer. When not designing, you can find me in RV campsites (Virginia to Florida)
                
                For as long as I can remember, I have been drawn to making things that people love. Let’s create something together. </p>
